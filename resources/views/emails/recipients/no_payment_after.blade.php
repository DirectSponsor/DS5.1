Dear {!!  $recipient->name  !!},

You have not responded to the previous request to notify the system whether or not you received payment from sponsor {!!  $sponsor->name  !!} due by {!!  $dueDate  !!}. It's crucial for your participation in the project that you keep the system informed, and failure to do so can result in suspension of your account, and thus your sponsorships. Please contact your coordinator or accounts@ds urgently to let us know what is happening.

Thank you

Direct Sponsor System.
