Dear {!! $sponsor->name !!}

We have not received a response from you about the email we sent you. It's crucial for the recipients to get their money as they are relying on it for their livelihood until they complete their project.

If you no longer wish to sponsor {!! $recipient->name !!}, you need do nothing and your account will be closed on {!!  $dueDate  !!} so that another sponsor can take your place, but if there has been an error, or this is just a temporary delay, do please let us know (accounts@directsponsor.org) or make a payment before that date.

Thank you

Direct Sponsor System.
